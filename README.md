# BattleShip-Strategy-Simulator
Battleship game simulator that consists of concise, structured logic and grid-based algorithms to perform an optimized ship placement strategy. Includes full unit testing and coverage. 
Constructed a deterministic strategy agent for the Battleship game using structured logic to handle ship placement and targeting. 
Implemented grid traversal algorithms and tracking to optimize gameplay strategy. 
Practiced unit testing and modular logic.
